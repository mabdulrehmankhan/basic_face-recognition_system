## Introduction

This project provides a basic implementation of a face recognition system. It utilizes Python and some common libraries, such as OpenCV and face_recognition, to detect and recognize faces in images. You can use this project as a starting point to build more advanced face recognition applications or learn about the fundamentals of face recognition.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library)
- face_recognition library

You can install the necessary Python libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install datetime
pip install cmake
pip install numpy
pip install os
pip install dlib
pip install face_recognition
```

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mabdulrehmankhan/basic_face-recognition_system.git
```

2. Change into the project directory:

```bash
cd basic_face-recognition_system
```

3. Install the required dependencies as mentioned in the "Prerequisites" section.

## Usage

Once you've installed the required libraries and cloned the repository, you can use the provided Python scripts to perform face recognition. Here's a brief overview of the main files in this repository:

- `recognize_faces.py`: This script allows you to recognize faces in images. You can customize it to use your own images and perform face recognition.

Example usage of the `recognize_faces.py` script:

```bash
python recognize_faces.py --image path_to_image.jpg
```

- `train_faces.py`: This script is used to train the face recognition model with a dataset of known faces. You can extend this script to train your own model with your dataset.

Example usage of the `train_faces.py` script:

```bash
python train_faces.py --dataset path_to_dataset
```

Feel free to explore the code and modify it to suit your specific needs.
